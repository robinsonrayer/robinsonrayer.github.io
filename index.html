<hr>
<p style="font-family: brodway;text-align: center;color: rgb(31, 31, 31);font-family: monospace;font-size: xx-large;"><b>God is the ultimate cause of our existence, he is full of unconditional love for us also not to mention he is personal and take care of us even when we don't care him,he bless the poors and rich equally but only the ones who follow his commands can have freedom others think they are having freedom but little did they know that is not true freedom one who follow the rules can experience true freedom even when it seem impossible in your eyes in his eyes all of them are possible.Now in this generation our subjective view may look well defined but truly without a objective view nothing can work.</b></p>
